# OpenTSDB Ruby client
[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/johnewart/ruby-opentsdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/johnewart/ruby-opentsdb)

## What is this?

This is a Ruby client for simplifying interactions with OpenTSDB.

## What does it do?

As of this instant, not a whole lot except wrap the "put" method in a
quick-and-dirty style. This will eventually grow to be much more useful
as I expand functionality.

## Requirements

ruby 1.9.3+

## Quick example

```ruby
  @client = OpenTSDB::Client.new(hostname: 'localhost', port: 4242)

  sample = {
    metric: 'double_rainbow.count',
    value: 42,
    timestamp: Time.now.to_i,
    tags: { factor: 'awesome', host: 'ponies' }
  }

  # Query one metric
  @client.put(sample)

  # Query many metrics
  @client.put([sample, sample])
```
